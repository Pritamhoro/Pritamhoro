Pritamhoro
👀 I’m interested in test automation, quality assurance, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and software development best practices.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced test automation frameworks, performance testing, and cloud-based testing solutions.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source testing projects, test automation frameworks, and tools that enhance software quality.
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving complex testing challenges and optimizing processes to help teams release high-quality software faster. I’m also a big fan of gaming and enjoy testing new games for bugs!
